    Call "good square" an n x n matrix with n >= 2 consisting of all numbers
    between 1 and n ** 2.
    Call "corrupted square" a good square exactly one of whose entries has been
    replaced by 0.

    Note: marks can be scored by just checking whether the square is good or corrupted,
    without fixing it in case it is corrupted -- but hard coding won't help.
